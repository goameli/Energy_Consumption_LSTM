  - University Project 2 - Angewandte Programmierung

For project purpose, LSTM Model has been trained with PyTorch and the model used to predict the points of unseen data. 

## Pipeline

1. General Imports
2. Load Data
3. Scaling the Data
4. Devide to Sequences / Labels
5. Split the Data to Train and Test
6. Build the LSTM Model & Initialize Weights
7. Train the Model
8. Evaluate the Model
9. Conclusion
